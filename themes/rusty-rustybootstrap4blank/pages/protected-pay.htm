	<p style="color: grey">VEND integrated a Protected Payment System powered by <a href="https://flutterwave.com.ng">Flutterwave</a>. This makes it difficult for fraudulent activities to be carried out against unsuspecting buyers. As a Seller, it helps to avoid unnecessary risks when it comes to selling products and services.<br><br>
    The system is built to protect both buyers and sellers in a transaction until agreed terms are met.

		 		<p style="color: grey">
Protected Pay keeps your payment pending until bought item(s) arrive, and  in good condition before you authorize settlement to the seller. Protected Pay removes the instances of payment without getting what you paid for. If you  do not get item(s) paid for, your money will be refunded back to your account.</p></div><br>


<div style=" font-size: 13px;  margin: 25px; margin-top: -7px"><p><b style=" font-size: 17px">Benefit for Sellers</b><br>
	<p style="color: grey">
Make buyers of your products feel comfortable paying online irrespective of distance by using the Protected Pay option. You can sell and deliver/waybill to any buyer regardless of where they are once you confirm payment. This ensures committment from the buyer and prevents the issues faced by sellers with pay on delivery(POD). </p></div><br>



<p style="font-size: 25px"><b>How it Works</b></p>
<hr>
<br>

<div style=" font-size: 13px;  margin: 25px; margin-top: -7px"><p><b><span><img style="width: 30px;" src="{{ 'assets/images/one.png'|theme }}"></span> Buyer & Seller agree to terms</b><br>

<p style="color: grey">
Buyer and Seller agree to terms on item(s) posted on the site by the seller, and the buyer chooses the Protected Pay option from the payment page of the posted Product/Service to make payment to the seller.</p></div><br>


<div style=" font-size: 13px;  margin: 25px; margin-top: -7px"><p><b><span><img style="width: 30px;" src="{{ 'assets/images/two.png'|theme }}"></span>Buyer Pays</b><br>

	<p style="color: grey">
Buyer pays and instantly recieves a reciept in an email with details of payment and the seller equally recieves a payment notification of the payment. Using Protected Pay flags the payment as <code>escrow</code> and the payment is automatically held pending against the seller's account.</p></div><br>


<div style=" font-size: 13px;  margin: 25px; margin-top: -7px"><p><b><span><img style="width: 30px;" src="{{ 'assets/images/three.png'|theme }}"></span>Seller delivers</b><br>

	<p style="color: grey">
Seller meets his side of the transaction by delivering item(s) or providing services according to advertised or agreed specification and timeframe.</p></div><br>

<div style=" font-size: 13px;  margin: 25px; margin-top: -7px"><p><b><span><img style="width: 30px;" src="{{ 'assets/images/four.png'|theme }}"></span>Payment Settlement</b><br>
	<p style="color: grey">
After item(s) has been delivered to the buyer, all the buyer has to do is copy the Six(6) digit "Settlement Code"(i.e 123456) sent in his payment reciept and on his profile page, click on "authorize settlement", input the code and click on "settle", the transaction fund is automatically removed from pending and processed into the seller's provided bank account. That simple!<br>
<code>Buyers are to settle sellers as soon as they confirm their item(s) or in at most 24hours.</code>
</p><br>

<div style="font-size: 18px"><b>How can a seller check if a payment has been settled?</b></div><br>
<p style="color: grey">
Once a buyer has settled a seller's fund, the seller can confirm this by going to his profile page and click on "verify a payment", copy the transaction reference(i.e PROTECTEDPAY-155398*********34455-PP) sent in the payment notification, input it  and click on "verify". The Protected Pay status should return with "Protected Pay Status: SETTLED" among other details of the payment. If it returns with "Protected Pay Status: PENDING", it means the transaction has not been settled and is still pending. If settlement is not made by the buyer after 24 hours of receiving item(s), the seller can raise a Payment issue to that effect from his Profile Page.
</p>

<div style="font-size: 18px"><b>What Happens if the Seller fails to deliver?</b></div><br>
<p style="color: grey">
All the buyer has to do is go to his Profile Page and click on "Payment issue", fill in the required fields and send. The seller will be sent a charge back email to respond to in at most 72 hours. If he agrees or totally ignores within the time frame, a refund is triggered by VEND using the transaction reference sent by the buyer and the fund held pending is returned back to the buyer's payment bank account. If the seller disagrees, then the seller has to provide verifiable proof that value for payment was given as agreed and it was recieved.
